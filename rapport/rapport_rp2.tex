%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% ==> Some hints are following:

\chapter{Instruction Fetch Stage}\label{instruction}

\section{Program Counter}\label{pc}

\begin{itemize}
	\item {Fonction :}
	Le registre \textbf{PC} (Programme Counter) contient l'adresse de la prochaine instruction à exécuter. Il doit pouvoir être initialisé à la valeur de l'adresse correspondant à la première instruction à executer. Cette valeur (adresse 0 de la mémoire d’instruction) est chargée dans le registre \textbf{PC} lorsque le signal d’entrée reset est égal à 0. 
	\item{Ressources d'entrée :}
	Le registre \textbf{PC} possède trois entrée :
	\begin{itemize}
		\item [clk] un std_logic relié à l' horloge du processeur.
		\item [reset] un std_logic qui lorsqu'il reçoit un signal charge la valeur 0 dans le registre.
		\item [adr_in] un std_logic_vector qui va recevoir l'adresse de la prochaine instruction. 
	\end{itemize}
	\item{Ressources de sortie :}
	Le registre \textbf{PC} possède une sortie :	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item [adr_out] un std_logic_vector qui va envoyer l'adresse de l'instruction à exécuter.
	\end{itemize}
	\item{Symbôle du bloc :}
	
	\begin{figure}
		\centering
			\includegraphics{../captures/pc_symb.PNG}
		\label{fig:pc_symb}
	\end{figure}
	
	\item{Simulation :}
			\includegraphics{../captures/pc_simu.PNG}
	
\end{itemize}




%There are problems with automatic hyphenation when using language
%specific characters and OT1-encoded fonts. In this case, use a
%T1-encoded Type1-font like the Latin Modern font family (\verb#\usepackage{lmodern}#).


\section{References}\label{references}
Using the commands \verb#\label{name}# and \verb#\ref{name}# you are able
to use references in your document. Advantage: You do not need to think
about numerations, because \LaTeX\ is doing that for you.

For example, in section \ref{dividing} on page \pageref{dividing} hints for
dividing large documents are given.

Certainly, references do also work for tables, figures, formulas\ldots

Please notice, that \LaTeX\ usually needs more than one run (mostly 2) to
resolve those references correctly.


\section{Dividing Large Documents}\label{dividing}
You can divide your \LaTeX-Document into an arbitrary number of \TeX-Files
to avoid too big and therefore unhandy files (e.g. one file for every chapter).

For this, you insert in your main file (this one) for every subfile
the command '\verb#\input{subfile}#'. This leads to the same behavior
as if the content of the subfile would be at the place of the \verb#\input#-Command.
